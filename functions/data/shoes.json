    "description": "Michael Jordan’s contract famously included a ‘Love of the Game’ clause that allowed him to play basketball in the offseason, a freedom he used to spend summers promoting the game through basketball clinics throughout the world. The Air Jordan 12 Retro ‘International Flight’ gives the nod to Jordan’s role as an ambassador, releasing as part of an International Flight Collection that celebrated important trips. This shoe recognizes his 1996 trip to Tokyo, featuring a kimono-style print throughout its College Navy suede upper and a koi scale pattern replacing the usual basketball texture on the mudguard. The characters down the heel strip translate to ‘Air Jordan.’"

The Air Jordan 12 'Playoffs' were retro'd in 2004 and 2012. As the first release to use the Twitter RSVP scheme, the 2012 retro set a milestone for Jordan Brand."
